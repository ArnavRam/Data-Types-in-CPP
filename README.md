# Experiment 2 - Program Structure and Data Types in C++

---

## Aim
- To study and demonstrate the basic data types in C++ (int, float, double, char, bool).
- To perform simple input and output operations on these data types.

---

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio

---

## Theory
In C++, every variable must be declared with a data type. A **data type** defines the kind of value a variable can hold and the amount of memory it occupies.

### Common Data Types:
- **int** → used to store integers.
- **float** → used to store decimal numbers with single precision.
- **double** → used to store decimal numbers with double precision.
- **char** → used to store a single character.
- **bool** → used to store logical values: `true` (1) or `false` (0).

The operator `sizeof()` is used to determine how many bytes each data type occupies in memory.  
Input is given using **cin** and output is displayed using **cout**, both defined in the `<iostream>` header.

## Algorithm / Logic

1. Start  
2. Include header file `<iostream>`  
3. Display sizes of different data types using `sizeof()`  
4. Declare variables of types `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`  
5. Take input from the user for each variable  
6. Display the values back using `cout`  
7. End

## Conclusion
The experiment helped in understanding the basic data types in C++ along with their sizes and how to take input and display output for each.
